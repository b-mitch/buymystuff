## What is Buy My Stuff??
Buy My Stuff is an e-commerce web app I build during the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course. Unlike other projects in the course, this one consists entirely of code I personally wrote. Codecademy simply provided the prompt - build an e-commerce web app using a RESTful API - and a very general project outline. The purpose of the site is to test and showcase my capabilities as a full-stack engineer. However, it can easily be implemented as the backbone of a production e-commerce web app.

## Usage
Please follow the following steps to set up the app locally.
<br>1. Download all files from the Buy My Stuff repository on github.

<br>2. Make sure your local Postgres server is running.
<br> ![Set Up Postres](./readme_images/postgres.png)
<br>3. Open your favorite Postgres client and create a new database for your e-commerce app. Import bms.sql from the db folder of the BMS repository
<br> ![Set Up Client](./readme_images/client.png)
<br>4. Navigate to the respository in your terminal and run the back-end locally.

<br>5. Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the view folder of the BMS repository. Run the front-end locally.
<br> ![Run the Front-End](./readme_images/frontend.png)
<br>6. And that's it! You should now see the By My Stuff e-commerce app open in your browser at localhost:3000.
